# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  There are many guidelines that should be followed in order to ensure that code, programs, or software meet functional requirements in a secure manner, but only a couple will be listed here. First, I believe that it is most important to ensure that developers strictly adhere to provided dependency and style guidlines working in a corporate or team environment. Doing so ensures that your work functions as intended, will integrate with a larger code base properly, and minimize potential security vulnerabilities. Next, testing methodologies should be thoroughly planned and maintained as you or your team progress through the development cycle. Throughout my studies of automated testing in this class it has been stressed repeatedly that common methods of testing (Black Box, White Box, etc.) are highly fragile as the code base evolves, so it is of great importance that the implemented tests are properly developed in parallel to the software.
  
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  User needs are the foundation of all software we develop. Through the provided requirements/desires, the developer is able to assess and plan the development process. Everything from language to platform to development philosophy will be determined by the needs of the intended user base.

# How do I approach designing software?
  I prefer to approach software design from a top-down perspective. I believe that approaching the problem from the most abstract level possible and breaking down the sub-systems from there is the most effective way to begin to plan the development process.
